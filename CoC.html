								<h3 class="major">Inclusivity Policy</h3>


<p>
All members of the Arecibo Science Advocacy Partnership (ASAP) shall treat one another and members of the p
	ublic with dignity and respect regardless of their gender identity, gender expression, age, 
	nationality, race, sexual orientation, health condition, disability, social status, veteran status, 
	religion and /or beliefs, parenthood or partnership status. Members will be encouraged to create an environment
	in which people are comfortable expressing themselves and what they need. We seek to ensure that everybody feels welcomed, accepted and safe.

</p>

<p>
ASAP will endeavour to proceed in a way that genuinely recognises the importance of an inclusive society that brings 
	opportunity, access and enjoyment, not barriers, to individuals.
It aims to ensure that no individual or group is directly or indirectly 
	discriminated against and is committed to minimise or remove discrimination 
	within the organisation. ASAP will endeavour to make reasonable adjustments 
	to working practices, equipment and premises and offer, where appropriate, 
	additional support to members to ensure they are able to take an active part in our proceedings. 
	Vulnerable members who require assistance for their needs and wish to attend any ASAP meetings 
	and/or events may be accompanied by a carer as necessary, thereby ensuring their safety, comfort and 
	well-being. A carer accompanying a vulnerable adult to meetings does not have to be an ASAP member.

 
</p>


<p>
ASAP affirms its commitment to its Puerto Rican members
	and aims to elevate their voices, both in our 
	advocacy and in our research-oriented efforts. 
	We also affirm our commitment to the welfare of 
	the staff of the Arecibo Observatory, irrespective of role and seniority. 

</p>

                
                    <h3 class="major">Harrassment and Discrimination Policy</h3>


<p>
The Arecibo Science Advocacy Partnership (ASAP) is committed to 
	fostering an environment in which all individuals are 
	treated with respect and dignity. Each individual has the 
	right to exist in a professional atmosphere that promotes equal 
	opportunities and prohibits discriminatory practices, including harassment. 
	Therefore, ASAP expects that all relationships among members will be cordial 
	and free of bias, prejudice, discrimination, and harassment. In order to keep 
	this commitment, ASAP maintains a no-tolerance policy toward harassment of any kind,
	including sexual harassment and harassment based on race, color, religion, national origin,
	sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, sex, age, physical or mental disability 
	or any other characteristic protected by state, federal or local employment discrimination laws. 

<b> This policy applies to all members and guests, including Arecibo Observatory staff and nonmembers in attendance. </b>

</p>

<p>
Discrimination is when a person is p
	revented from taking part in s
	omething based on a particular characteristic they have. 
	Harassment is when someone behaves in a way which makes someone 
	else feel distressed, humiliated or threatened. Harassment based on a 
	protected category is considered by the law to be hate crime, and can be reported 
	to law enforcement. Sexual harassment includes but is not limited to, 
	making unwanted sexual advances and requests for sexual favors, especially where such 
	conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual’s 
	wellbeing or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment. 

<b> Members who violate this policy are subject to penalties up to and including immediate revocation of membership. </b>

 
</p>


<p>
Examples of unlawful harassment include, but are not limited to:<br>
- Verbal conduct such as epithets, derogatory jokes or comments, slurs or unwanted sexual advances, invitations or comments. <br>
- Visual conduct such as derogatory and/or sexually-oriented posters, photography, cartoons, drawings, e-mail and faxes or gestures. <br>
- Physical conduct such as assault, unwanted touching, blocking normal movement or interfering inappropriately with a member’s activities. <br>
- Digital interference, stalking, blackmail, hacking, or other similar behavior. <br>
- Threats and demands to submit to sexual requests in order to avoid a loss.<br>
- Retaliation for having reported or threatened to report unlawful harassment. <br>	
</p>

<p>
Any member who believes he or she has been harassed by another member of ASAP or 
	by a guest participating in ASAP’s activities is asked to promptly report 
	the facts of the incident or incidents and the names of the individual(s) 
	involved to a trusted member of the board, or the leader of a committee, or 
	another trusted member (who may advocate for them if requested). Upon receipt 
	of a complaint, ASAP will undertake a prompt, thorough, objective and good faith
	investigation of the harassment allegations. If ASAP determines that harassment has occurred, 
	effective remedial action will be taken in accordance with the circumstances involved. 
	Any member determined by the Agency to be responsible for harassment will be subject to appropriate 
	disciplinary action, up to and including revocation of membership. Members who have been subject to 
	improper behaviour will not be retaliated against for filing a complaint and/or assisting in a 
	complaint or investigation process. Further, we will not tolerate or permit retaliation against any 
	complainant or anyone assisting in a harassment investigation.
