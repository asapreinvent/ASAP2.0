ASAP2.0 Bylaws Intro (Final version coming)

The goals of ASAP are articulated in its Statement of Purpose (SoP)
and mission statement. Its membership is open to anyone, and consists
of voting members (who are not employees of NAIC/UCF), and non-voting
members (employees of NAIC/UCF).

ASAP in general follows a "Shared Leadership Model", with all members
having equal weight/voice. All non-NAIC/UCF employees can lead a committee
or initiative.

The ASAP Management Board will consist of at least 10 members who agree
with organization goals as articulated in its Statement of Purpose (SoP)
and mission statement, and are prepared to promote these actively. The
board members will consist of 6 "at large" ASAP members elected (or
re-elected) to three-year terms of service by a free vote of all ASAP
members, and in addition a representative of each of the ASAP Standing
Committees.

The Board is the responsible authority for every aspect of ASAP --
i.e. its goals, positions, actions, website and finances.  A vote of
half of the sitting Board plus one will be required to adopt any goal
or position. A 2/3 board majority is needed to amend the SoP, mission
statement or these Bylaws.  Issues raised and seconded by any two Board
members will be discussed and voted on promptly by the Board. Voting
will be carried out electronically, initially by e-mail.  Board members
will make every effort to vote promptly.

The ASAP fee structure is based on career level -- undergraduate fee
level, graduate fee level, full fee level (i.e. anything beyond graduate
student).  Again, the fee level has no impact on participation, voting
power, etc.
