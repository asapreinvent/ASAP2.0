								<h3 class="major">ASAP BOARD STRUCTURE AND BYLAWS</h3>

<p> 
 The goals of ASAP are articulated in its Statement of Purpose (SoP)
and mission statement. Its membership is open to anyone, and consists
of voting members (who are not employees of NAIC/UCF), and non-voting
members (employees of NAIC/UCF). ASAP in general follows a "Shared Leadership Model", with all members
having equal weight/voice. All non-NAIC/UCF employees can lead a committee
or initiative.

</p>
								    
<p>
 The ASAP Management Board will consist of at least 13 members who agree
with organization goals as articulated in its Statement of Purpose
(SoP) and mission statement, and are prepared to promote these actively.
The board members will consist of 9 x "at-large" ASAP members elected
(or re-elected) to three-year terms of service by a free vote of all
ASAP members, and in addition a representative of each of the ASAP
Standing Committees (see below). Ideally, the primary interests of the
9 "at-large" board members will be divided 3 x space and atmospheric
physicists, 3 x planetary radar astronomers, and 3 x radio astronomers.

</p>



<p>
After initial "population" of the Board with 3 "legacy" and 6 elected
members agreeing to serve for terms of 1, 2 or 3 years, 3 board members
will be replaced/re-elected by an election of the full ASAP membership
each year. If a board member resigns, or is otherwise removed from, the
Board before completion of their term of service, the Board will co-opt
a replacement for the remainder of their term. Of the 3 "at-large" board
members elected annually to 3-year terms of service, representatives
should be elected from each of the three scientific disciplines which
have primary long-term interest in Arecibo operations, (i.e. aeronomy,
solar-system physics and radio astronomy).

</p>

 <p>
   The Board is the responsible authority for every aspect of ASAP --
i.e. its goals, positions, actions, website and finances.  A vote of
half of the sitting Board plus one will be required to adopt any goal
or position. A 2/3 board majority is needed to amend the SoP, mission
statement or these Bylaws.  Issues raised and seconded by any two Board
members will be discussed and voted on promptly by the Board. Voting
will be carried out over Zoom in real time, if there is a quorum. Otherwise, it can be done electronically, via google form, Slack, or e-mail.
   Board members will make every effort to vote promptly.  In case of ties, the chair of the Board will cast the deciding vote.


                    </p>

          <p>
   Only Board members may speak officially on behalf of ASAP,  and then only in keeping
with previously agreed ASAP goals and positions.  Board and ASAP members will
distinguish clearly in their public statements between ASAP positions,
and those they express as individuals. Adopted ASAP goals and positions
will be posted in appropriate sections of the ASAP website.


                    </p>
                    
          <p>
   ASAP will host a number of standing committees to consider different
aspects of the future of Arecibo Observatory, and the interactions
between the Observatory and its community in the broadest sense. Each
such committee will choose its own leadership, who will determine one of
its number to serve as an ASAP Board member.  <br>

The ASAP Board will elect an Executive Committee comprised of a Chair,
vice-Chair and past Chair, all with one-year terms.  The Board is
empowered to fill all three positions as needed.

                   </p>
                    
          <p>
            <b> Committees </b>   
                    </p>
                    
         <p>
   Committees are encouraged to organize themselves around an agreed mission  
statement or work plan and to select their structure and leadership.  <br>
Each committee will select a Board representative for a definite term and do so
as needed so it can be continuously represented.<br>
The Board is responsible for coordinating the committees that form and operate 
under ASAP auspices. <br>
Selected committee representatives serve as full Board members for the terms 
of their committee appointments. <br>
Committee-selected Board members will keep the Board informed on committee 
activities and the committee informed about Board decisions, advice and requests.

                    </p>
                    
                    
          <p>
   The ASAP fee structure is based on career level -- undergraduate fee
level, graduate fee level, full fee level (i.e. anything beyond graduate
student).  Again, the fee level has no impact on participation, voting
power, etc.

                    </p>
       
                    <p>
                      The ASAP Board will select persons for the roles of Treasurer,
Corresponding Secretary and Membership Coordinator.
The ASAP Board will create particular roles and positions of
responsibility as needed. These will be filled through nomination
and election. Board members may volunteer to take on special roles or
activities on an 'ad hoc' basis, subject to Board direction and approval.
Such roles will be formalized as appropriate by election within six
months. The Board Secretary, initially a volunteer, will be subject to
election as above, or may represent a temporary need.

                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      The ASAP Board will hold virtual meetings monthly, and
more often should events require. A quorum will consist of 6 members,
including the Chair (or their appointed substitute.) The Chair will
facilitate these meetings, providing an agenda 24 hours in advance to
all Board members. The Board Secretary will be responsible for providing
e-mail minutes to all board members within 48 hours of the meeting,
indicating decisions made or to be made. They will also separately specify
'action items'.

                    </p>
