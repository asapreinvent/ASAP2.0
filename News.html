<h3 class="major">Congressional Letter Writing Campaign!</h3>


<p>
<b>We started a letter writing campaign towards 
the end of June to urge Congress to provide funds
for the design and construction of a new 
Arecibo telescope. The Senate had just passed
the US Innovation and Competition Act 
(known as
the Endless Frontier Act in Congress), which included funding for various STEM 
activities that were conducted by the legacy Arecibo telescope and would be conducted with 
a new telescope. We asked ASAP members and Arecibo Observatory supporters to write 
letters to their representatives . It is still not too late to write to your representatives 
as the bill has yet to be discussed in Congress.
We urge all Arecibo supporters to help with 
this. An example letter and instructions on how
to contact your representative can be found 
<a href="https://www.cienciapr.org/es/forum-topic/aboga-por-el-observatorio-de-arecibo-ante-el-congreso-de-eeuu-contact-us-congress-and", target="blank"> here. </a>

<b>You can feel free to use this when Advocating for Arecibo </b> <br>
 The Arecibo Observatory, a National Science Foundation (NSF) facility located in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, suffered a devastating loss when its main instrument, the 305-meter radar/radio telescope, collapsed in December of 2020. For nearly 60 years, the Arecibo Observatory made ground-breaking scientific contributions to the fields of astronomical, planetary, and atmospheric sciences. It was also at the heart of extensive public outreach and science education programs that inspired thousands of students in Puerto Rico and the U.S. to pursue careers in science and engineering.
<br>
Astronomical research at Arecibo has a rich history of enhancing our understanding of the universe. The first planets outside our solar system were detected at Arecibo, and observations of the first known double neutron star system led to the awarding of the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics. The Observatory was also host to the world’s most powerful and sensitive planetary radar system, which was central to NASA's efforts to accomplish its Congressionally mandated mission to identify all potentially hazardous asteroids (i.e., Near-Earth Objects). And the Observatory had the unique ability to study the upper atmosphere at altitudes ranging from about 60 to 2500 km, making key contributions to our understanding of the interactions between the Sun's magnetic field and the Earth's atmosphere.
<br>
The Observatory is home to the Angel Ramos Foundation Science & Visitor Center, which welcomed nearly 100,000 visitors a year, and supported Science Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math (STEAM) education at all levels throughout Puerto Rico and beyond. The Visitor Center's programs, along with the Observatory's longstanding Research Experiences for Undergraduates summer program, have motivated many students from all over the U.S. and Puerto Rico to pursue degrees in a wide range of science and engineering fields.
<br>
Over the last few years, the NSF and NASA awarded the Observatory approximately $20 million dollars for new instruments, research and education programs. These investments indicate that Arecibo had all the potential to continue conducting cutting-edge science and impactful STEAM education for many years to come.     
<br>
There is no other radar/radio telescope in the U.S. like the one that existed at the Arecibo Observatory. Recently, the FAST telescope, a large radio telescope similar to the one that was at the Arecibo Observatory, started operations in China. It is therefore imperative that a new, more sensitive, Arecibo radar/radio telescope is built for the U.S. to maintain its competitiveness in the field. 
<br>
The version of the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act that was passed by the Senate calls out specific actions that will be possible with a new Arecibo telescope (and many of them were already being done with the old telescope). These include: 
<br>
	-Space Situational Awareness (Sections 2604 and 2605 in Bill S. 1260)<br>
-Planetary Defense (Sec. 2640)<br>
-Search for Life through search of technosignatures (Sec. 2633, paragraph 4) <br>
-Programs to address the STEM workforce and STEM education (Sections 2202, 2210, 2662 and 2663)<br>

Funding the design and construction of a new Arecibo radar/radio telescope will not only address these topics that are highlighted in Bill S. 1260, but will also ensure that the U.S. maintains its leadership in the areas of astronomy, planetary and atmospheric sciences. We therefore ask that language be introduced to the United States Innovation and Competition Act that specifically indicates that the NSF should fund the design and construction of a new Arecibo telescope.
